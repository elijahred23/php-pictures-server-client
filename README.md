# php-pictures-server-client

Here's an example implementation of a PHP web server that allows users to upload images by providing a URL and folder name, and stores the information in a JSON file. The server also provides an endpoint at /folders that returns a JSON list of all folders and their associated image files.


To use the command line client, you can run `php client.php upload <image_url> <folder_name>` to upload an image, and `php client.php folders` to list all folders and their associated images.
